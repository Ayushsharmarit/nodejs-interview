/**
 * The Worker Threads module is used for running CPU-intensive tasks in parallel without blocking the main event loop.
How It Works:
The main thread creates a worker thread to handle a CPU-heavy calculation.
The worker performs the task in parallel and sends back the result.

Use Case:
âœ… Image processing, video encoding, machine learning, cryptography, and parsing large files.
