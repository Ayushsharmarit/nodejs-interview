/**
 * 
How It Works:
The master process forks multiple worker processes (equal to the number of CPU cores).
Each worker handles incoming HTTP requests.
If a worker crashes, a new worker is automatically created.

Use Case:
âœ… Web servers, REST APIs, and GraphQL servers that handle many concurrent users.
